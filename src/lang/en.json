    "About Food":"Food, the silent narrator of cultural identities, takes us on a journey through the entrenched habits and professions of diverse peoples. It stands as an ancient tree, its robust trunk bearing witness to thousands of years of human history. In Iran, the culinary culture is a tapestry woven with various beliefs and customs, offering a window into the cultural affairs of its people. Cheese, like many foods, carries the history of Iran within its curds. It serves as a full-length mirror reflecting ancient Iran. Its importance has been echoed time and again in Iranian mythology and ancient texts. Consider the verses from an ancient Sassanid treatise, where a palm tree and a goat engage in a discourse of superiority and wisdom. The goat, in its humble wisdom, speaks of its milk turning into cheese, a staple for the royal palace. This dialogue underscores the significance of cheese in Iranâ€™s history, a tradition that continues to thrive among Iranians. Cheese-making in Iran is a communal art, a testament to the tradition of cooperation and participation prevalent since ancient times. This is why cheeses bear the names of cities or regions, not individuals. Each taste, each story about a cheese, is a journey to that region and its people."
